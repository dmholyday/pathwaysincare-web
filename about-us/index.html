    <p>Based in Greenwood, with over 15 years' experience as a Hospital Social Worker in the Perth Northern suburbs, we
      bring deep expertise at the intersection of healthcare and aged care. We also draw from many years of personal
      experience, with our own elderly parents, supporting in-home care, carers, and aged care transitions.</p>
    
    <p>Grounded in relationships — not commissions — our approach is personal, respectful, and always in your best
      interest.</p>
