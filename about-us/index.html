    <p>At <em>Pathways in Care</em>, our goal is to help families navigate the aged care system with trusted advice, practical support, and ethical advocacy.  Whether you&#39;re arranging home services, seeking residential care, advocating for a loved one, or simply need someone who understands the system — We are here to guide you.</p>
    
    <p>We&#39;re here to reduce the confusion of navigating this complex system, ease your stress through expert guidance, and free up your time for the people and priorities that matter most.</p>
    
    <p>Based in Greenwood, with over 15 years&#39; experience as a Hospital Social Worker in the Perth Northern suburbs, we bring deep expertise at the intersection of healthcare and aged care.  We also draw from many years of personal experience, with our own elderly parents, supporting in-home care, carers, and aged care transitions.</p>
    
    <p>Grounded in relationships — not commissions — our approach is personal, respectful, and always in your best interest.</p>

        <h3>Meet Kirsty <span class="founder-text">- Founder</span></h3>
        <p>Kirsty is a dedicated Social Worker with extensive experience in Aged Care and Geriatric Medicine. While she has worked across many areas of hospital social work, her greatest passion has always been supporting older people and their families.</p>
        <p>During her hospital career, Kirsty saw how often families were left to navigate the complex aged care system on their own. With hospitals under increasing pressure, social workers could only provide limited guidance, leaving families to face a confusing and emotional process alone.</p>
        <p>This inspired Kirsty to create <strong>Pathways in Care</strong> — a service built on ethical, person-centred practice and strong advocacy. She draws on over 15 years of professional expertise, strong sector connections, and her own personal experience caring for her parents, to match clients with the right services and provide both practical and emotional support.</p>
        <p>Kirsty is known for her integrity, compassion, and creative problem-solving. She has designed her service to be affordable and accessible, ensuring families of all means can get the support they need. Above all, Kirsty’s focus is on guiding families with respect, empathy, and trusted expertise during one of life’s most challenging transitions.</p>
