                    <p><strong>Community Home Support</strong> gives you basic help at home, such as cleaning, showering assistance, transport, or shopping. It’s quicker to set up because you don’t need a full Aged Care Assessment (ACAT). Support is usually limited to around 2–3 hours a week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Home Care Packages</strong> provide more flexible, ongoing support. They do require an Aged Care Assessment and are available in four levels, each with a set amount of funding. Higher levels (3 and 4) offer more hours and services, helping people with greater care needs to stay at home. From 1 November 2025, the new Aged Care Act will make some changes to how these packages work.</p>

                    <p>Yes. If you’re not getting the most out of your package or the services don’t suit your needs, we can step in on your behalf. We’ll work with your provider to make sure you receive the care and support that’s right for you and your family.</p>
