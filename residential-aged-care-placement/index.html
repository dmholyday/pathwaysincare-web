        <p>Our residential placement services are here to support you in finding the right aged care option based on what matters most to you — whether that’s location, being close to family, or working within your financial circumstances. We understand that every situation is different, which is why we offer both general guidance and a more comprehensive service tailored to your individual needs and preferences. Our goal is to make this transition as informed, stress free, supported, and compassionate as possible.</p>
        <h4>What to expect in our initial consultation</h4>
        <br>
        <p>In our first meeting, we take the time to understand your individual needs and circumstances. We’ll provide a clear explanation of residential aged care and walk you through the process of accessing this type of care. We’ll also outline the associated costs and fees, so you can make informed decisions. During this consultation, we’ll work with you to determine the level of support you’d like from us moving forward, tailored to your unique situation.</p>
