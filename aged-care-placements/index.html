        <p>Our residential placement services are here to support you in finding the right aged care option based on what matters most to you — whether that’s location, being close to family, or working within your financial circumstances. We understand that every situation is different, which is why we offer both general guidance and a more comprehensive service tailored to your individual needs and preferences. Our goal is to make this transition as informed, stress free, supported, and compassionate as possible.</p>
        <h4>What to expect in our initial consultation</h4>
        <br>
        <p>In our first meeting, we take the time to understand your individual needs and circumstances. We’ll provide a clear explanation of residential aged care and walk you through the process of accessing this type of care. We’ll also outline the associated costs and fees, so you can make informed decisions. During this consultation, we’ll work with you to determine the level of support you’d like from us moving forward, tailored to your unique situation.</p>

                    <p>It depends greatly on your individual circumstances. In a system under so much pressure, and wait lists up to a year long in some locations, we look for the best available options to suit your individual needs, and advocate strongly to secure the placement in a timely fashion.</p>

                    <p>The Basic Service helps you to understand what is required to enter Aged Care, provides you with resources and information on how to complete the process yourself, and points you in the right direction with recommendations for appropriate facilities to contact.</p>
                    <p>With the Complete Service, we do all the forms and contacting Aged Care homes for you, keeping you informed of progress, updates and offers of placement, before arranging tours for you to view the homes. Once you accept the offer, we organise the admission to the Aged Care Home, keeping all parties up to date with progress and plans.</p>
