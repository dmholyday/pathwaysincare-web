        <p>We begin by meeting with you to understand your individual circumstances through a comprehensive assessment. This allows us to explore all available options and resources— to achieve your goal of remaining living safely and comfortably at home.</p>
        <p>Support provided may include helping you access services and entitlements you and your loved ones may be eligible for, such as Carer Payments and Allowances, government-funded Community Home Support or Home Care Packages, in-home respite, short-term residential respite, and assistive technology solutions.</p>
        <p>We can coordinate referrals to My Aged Care, liaise with your GP or healthcare providers, and connect you with in-home supports, community supports and Day Centres.</p>
        <p>Importantly, we can also advocate on your behalf with existing services and providers to ensure you're receiving the most appropriate and responsive care for your unique needs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Community Home Support</strong> gives you basic help at home, such as cleaning, showering assistance, transport, or shopping. It’s quicker to set up because you don’t need a full Aged Care Assessment (ACAT). Support is usually limited to around 2–3 hours a week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Home Care Packages</strong> provide more flexible, ongoing support. They do require an Aged Care Assessment and are available in four levels, each with a set amount of funding. Higher levels (3 and 4) offer more hours and services, helping people with greater care needs to stay at home. From 1 November 2025, the new Aged Care Act will make some changes to how these packages work.</p>

                    <p>Yes. If you’re not getting the most out of your package or the services don’t suit your needs, we can step in on your behalf. We’ll work with your provider to make sure you receive the care and support that’s right for you and your family.</p>
