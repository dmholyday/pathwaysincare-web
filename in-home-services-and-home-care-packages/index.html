        <p>We begin by meeting with you to understand your individual circumstances through a comprehensive assessment. This allows us to explore all available options and resourcesâ€” to achieve your goal of remaining living safely and comfortably at home.</p>
        <p>Support provided may include helping you access services and entitlements you and your loved ones may be eligible for, such as Carer Payments and Allowances, government-funded Community Home Support or Home Care Packages, in-home respite, short-term residential respite, and assistive technology solutions.</p>
        <p>We can coordinate referrals to My Aged Care, liaise with your GP or healthcare providers, and connect you with in-home supports, community supports and Day Centres.</p>
        <p>Importantly, we can also advocate on your behalf with existing services and providers to ensure you're receiving the most appropriate and responsive care for your unique needs.</p>
