    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At <em>Pathways in Care</em>, our goal is to help families navigate the aged care system with trusted advice, practical support, and ethical advocacy. Whether you're arranging home services, seeking residential care, advocating for a loved one, or simply need someone who understands the system — We are here to guide you.</p>
    <p>We're here to reduce the confusion of navigating this complex system, ease your stress through expert guidance, and free up your time for the people and priorities that matter most.</p>
    <p>Based in Greenwood, with over 15 years' experience as a Hospital Social Worker in the Perth Northern suburbs, we bring deep expertise at the intersection of healthcare and aged care. We also draw from many years of personal experience, with our own elderly parents, supporting in-home care, carers, and aged care transitions.</p>
    <p>Grounded in relationships — not commissions — our approach is personal, respectful, and always in your best interest.</p>
