    <div class="text">    
      <p>At <em>Pathways in Care</em>, we navigate the complexities of Aged Care for you. With over 15 years of Hospital Social Work experience, we know the aged care system inside and out — cutting through red tape, explaining complex processes and costs so it makes sense, and advocating fiercely for your family&#39;s needs.</p>
      <p>We handle the large amount of paperwork, apply to as many appropriate Aged Care Homes as necessary, and guide you through every decision with clarity and compassion.</p>
      <p>We work for you and your loved one, to get you the outcome you need as soon as possible. No commissions, no conflicts of interest — just trusted expertise when you need it most.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to make the process as stress free as possible and give you back the time to focus on what truly matters: being present for your loved one during this challenging transition.</p>

Kirsty was compassionate, understanding and very prompt in finding a placement. She took away a lot of the stress involved by liasing with the hospital and nursing home for a very fast and smooth transition to the nursing home. After the admission it was lovely to hear from Kirsty checking up that everything was OK. Thanks Kirsty"</p>
