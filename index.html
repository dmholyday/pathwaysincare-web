    <p class="review-text">The aged care system isn't designed for families in crisis. When your loved one's health declines, you're suddenly thrust into a maze of assessments, waitlists, and bureaucracy — all while costs mount and time runs out.</p>
    <p class="review-text">Navigating My Aged Care, coordinating multiple healthcare providers, deciphering complex fee structures, and completing endless paperwork shouldn't fall on families already stretched to their limit. Yet that's exactly what happens when you need care the most.</p>
    <p class="review-text">The emotional toll is immense: making life-changing decisions under pressure, managing family conflicts over care options, and carrying the weight of responsibility while watching someone you love struggle with independence and dignity.</p>
